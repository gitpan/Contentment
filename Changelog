Contentment 0.9.18 Beta:

	* Did some work to update t/node.t and get those tests working.
	* Added t/security_dbi.t to test Contentment::Security and
	  Contentment::Security::DBI and fixed a bunch of bugs related to writing
	  that test.
	* Changed the default original_kind in the context to 'text/html' from
	  'unknown'. (This is a web application after all.)
	* Hard-coded the open_session and close_session in order to allow for a
	  complete context without a lot of fuss.
	* Locked the system into using SPOPS::DBI::MySQL to fix some id field bugs
	  found with t/security_dbi.t. Obviously, I would like to undo this in the
	  future to allow for different databases to be used.
	* Fixed a bunch of security related bugs by adding { skip_security => 1 } in
	  a few key places where this is appropriate.
	* Updated check_action_security() in Contentment::SPOPS so that it throws
	  exceptions on creation when a requirement fails.
	* Added lots of extra debugging and logging code.
	* Fixed a bug in get_security() of Contentment::SPOPS that caused the system
	  to sometimes fail while calculating the ID.
	* Completely changed the way capability_names are mapped to security levels.
	  (I.e., what the hell was I thinking when I wrote the original code!?)
	* The default get_security() method (in Contentment::SPOPS) is a little more
	  conservative in calculating security levels (as it always should have
	  been).
	* Fixed the way global_current_user() and global_current_group() are
	  calculated in Contentment::SPOPS as they were using a very old session
	  implementation.
	* Refactored all references to $Contentment::context to
	  Contentment->context.
	* Fixed the SPOPS configuration for Contentment::Security::Permission.
	* Added a can_create() method to Contentment::Session to allow all users to
	  create sessions.
	* Altered open_session() in Contentment::Session to make it work even when
	  called outside a web request (in case someone (me) wants to write a script
	  to use Contentment without a browser).
	* Altered context construction to work a bit better.
	* Added a destructor to Contentment::Context that calls close_session() of
	  Contentment::Session. I have marked it with a TODO because I don't know if
	  this is the best place for this.
	* Added DateTime support to Contentment::Security::DBI::User and
	  Contentment::Security::DBI::Group.
	* Altered the definition of the database tables for
	  Contentment::Security::DBI::User and Contentment::Security::DBI::Group to
	  make it a little less restrictive.
	* Added code to automatically update ctime, mtime, and dtime when
	  appropriate in Contentment::Security::DBI::User and
	  Contentment::Security::DBI::Group.
	* Added custom get_security() methods to Contentment::Security::DBI::User
	  and Contentment::Security::DBI::Group to always allow users to view their
	  own user and groups.
	* Updated check_login() in Contentment::Security::DBI to set the lastlog
	  field of the user on successful login, to give better log information, to
	  use the latest notion of a session, and to load the actual user record
	  into the current_user slot of the context.
	* Updated fetch_user() and fetch_group() of Contentment::Security::DBI to
	  fetch users and groups by either ID or username/groupname.
	* Altered the %R spec of the sample Log4perl configurations to use "none"
	  instead of undef when REMOTE_ADDR isn't set in the environment (when
	  Contentment is used as a stand-alone app rather than as a web script).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r501 | sterling | 2005-07-28 22:35:00 -0500 (Thu, 28 Jul 2005) | 3 lines

	* Added a work-around to the release target to allow Module::Release and
	  friends to request input from the user.

Contentment 0.9.17 Beta:

	* Set t/node.t and t/nodelet.t to skip as those APIs are unfinished.
	* Added context requests for plain and Mason-request context
	* Added support for making releases with Brian D Foy's excellent
	  Module::Release code. There is now a "./Build release" command to do all
	  the dirty work automatically and I made a custom extension
	  Module::Build::HANENKAMP based upon Module::Build::Extras by Nik Clayton.
	* Added the context() method to Contentment for easy creation/retrieval of
	  the current context information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r499 | sterling | 2005-07-21 13:13:31 -0500 (Thu, 21 Jul 2005) | 6 lines

	* Updated Mason requirement to 1.23 for the HTML::Mason::FakeApache::method
	  method.
	* Added some guts to main.css in the default style, mostly so that we can
	  have something to test in t/sample_css.t
	* Altered /content/util/generate to make the "to" command work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

	  t/node.t, all but one test fail.

Contentment 0.9.16 Beta:

	* Fixed a bug in the test action of Contentment::Build whereby
	* make_executable() was called on the wrong path, when it should have been
	* called on t/htdocs/cgi-bin/handler.cgi.
	* Added a new build target named "dbclean" to clean up the test database.
	* This target finds all tables in the testdb database database and drops.
	* Changed quoting in a call to DBI::tables in Contentment::SPOPS to be a
	* little more robust.
	* Added/renamed some fields in Contentment::Content::Node and
	* Contentment::Content::Revision.
	* Started filling out Contentment::Content::Nodelet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r495 | sterling | 2005-07-15 20:08:38 -0500 (Fri, 15 Jul 2005) | 20 lines

Contentment 0.9.15 Beta:

	* Updated test framework to use Apache::Test when available to do live
	  server tests. This will allow for a wide range of very complete tests to
	  be performed. I'm going to try and make test writing my primary debugging
	  process since I didn't write tests up front.
	* Added missing t/lib/Foo/Bar.pm file.
	* Added a simple test to make sure the system starts and can return the
	  sample index page.
	* Commented the caching code in Contentment as it is causing problems. I've
	  also switched the caching system to the Cache::NullCache object for now.
	* Updated various SPOPS classes to use SPOPSx::Tool::YAML instead of
	  SPOPSx::Tool::Hashfield. This includes those classes defined within the 
	  Contentment::Setting, Contentment::Session, Contentment::Security::DBI,
	  and Contentment::Form modules.
	* Updated the File::System requirement to 1.13 (was 1.03, which is not
	  adequate).
	* Added Apache::Test to the recommended list (i.e., tests will function
	  without Apache::Test, but the really useful ones will be skipped).

Contentment 0.9.14 Beta:

	* Removed SPOPSx::Tool::DateTime and SPOPSx::Tool::Hashfield (they've been
	  forked into the SPOPSx-Tool-DateTime and SPOPSx-Tool-YAML distros).
	* Added SPOPSx::Tool::DateTime and SPOPSx::Tool::YAML to the build
	  requirements.
	* Added an initial version of Contentment::Content::Node.
	* Added the documentation for Contentment::Content::Nodelet describing the
	  planned design/implementation.

r487 | sterling | 2005-06-25 15:22:17 -0500 (Sat, 25 Jun 2005) | 12 lines

Contentment 0.9b12:

	* Added tie tests to capture_streams test (when either IO::String or
	  IO::Scalar are present).
	* Added a hack to handler.fcgi so that Contentment::capture_streams can work
	  when FCGI::Stream is in use (by the FCGI module wrapped by CGI::Fast).
	* Better logging in handler.fcgi.
	* Altered the cgi-bin/.htaccess file so that only files ending in .cgi are
	  treated as CGI rather than all files.
	* Added a condition to htdocs/htaccess.sample so that we can leave static
	  files to the webserver if we drop them within htdocs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contentment 0.9b11:

	* PROGRESS [cpan #13312] Added is_debug checks before all debug log
	  statements in all of the Perl modules. Need to do the same on the content
	  files.
	* Contentment::FileType::HTML wouldn't render because it was missing a
	  generate_headers() method. Fixed by making it ISA
	  Contentment::FileType::Other.
	* PROGRESS [cpan #13312] Added a FastCGI target handler, added some related
	  files, altered Build.PL to recommend FCGI and generate the new
	  handler.fcgi file, and got the FastCGI interface generally working.
	* Fixed a dumb typo in handler.cgi that resulted in
	  HTML::Mason::CGIHandler::new being called twice.

Contentment 0.9b10:

	* FIX [cpan #13341]: Added first two unit tests capture_streams and
	  configuration along with a testing framework and modified
	  Contentment::Config for it.  This was simpler than I thought it would be.
	  I'm going to try and add a few more tests with each revision.

Contentment 0.9b9:

	* Added the cache() method to Contentment to give Contentment modules a easy
	  way to cache data.
	* Use the cache() method in call_hooks() of Contentment as an attempt to
	  speed up the hooking process. May or may not stay.
	* Lowered log levels for  because logging was too verbose in some places.
	* Added the generate_headers() method to the file type API to assist in the
	  generation of top level responses.
	* Altered the generator for Contentment::FileType::Other to use read()
	  instead of <> for performance reasons.
	* Added DBD::mysql 2.9008 to the recommended list in the build script.
	* Altered the default temporary directory to be less Mason-centric and
	  adjusted settings elsewhere to support this change.
	* Changed the sample configuration to be correct YAML in the VFS
	  configuration.
	* Changed /content/themes/apply_theme so that it uses the configured
	  defaults instead of always using 'default' as the default theme and 'main'
	  as the default master.
	* Altered /content/util/crumbtrail so that it outputs a non-breaking space
	  when there are no entries in the crumbtrail to keep that box from
	  collapsing.
	* Added support for HEAD requests in /content/util/generate. This component
	  is likely to be removed in the very near future.

	* HTML::Mason::Component::FileBased to fix a bug with content/util/index
	* Added Contentment::Manual::Bugs to the table of contents of
	* Contentment::Manual
	* Changed the short title of Contentment::Manual to Manual.
	* Simplified the code of get_property() in Contentment::VFS which is faster
	* and fixes a bug with attributes being missed sometimes.
	* Added a RESOLVED section to Contentment::Manual::Bugs.
	* Added index.* files to the default non_indexed_files setting and removed
	* *.xls from the same list.
	* Added the prun_unindexed argument to content/util/index to allow the user
	* to choose to index directories not containing index.* (previously these
	* were never indexed).

Contentment 0.9b7:

	* Again fixed the title of Contentment in the documentation.
	* Made a minor documentation improvment to Contentment.
	* Fixed Contentment->capture_stream() so that it handled errors as
	  perscribed in the documentation.
	* Fixed content/input/dhandler so that directory redirects do not ad a
	  superfluous slash.
	* Added better error handling to content/input/dhandler when a requested
	  path doesn't exist.
	* Added some debug statements to content/input/autohandler that should
	  probably be removed eventually, but are handy for now.
	* Fixed a typo in an error message in
	  content/transform/apply_transformation.mason
	* Changed the behavior of content/transform/apply_transformation.mason so
	  that it returns the original output if no transformations can be found.
	  This is a lot handier, if not a bit dangerous. The behavior needs
	  tweaking, of course.
	* Switched content/util/index to grab theme masters correctly

Contentment 0.9b6

	* Added the Contentment->capture_streams() method to add in all the fancy

	  property.

	  request/preprocess.

Contentment 0.9b5

	* Bug: Continuing to tweak the main handler to make it work better and be
	  more robust.
	* Bug: Altered the dhandler to deal with strange input from HTML::Mason
	  (i.e., with a custom resolver it doesn't appear to properly strip the
	  parent directories out of dhandler_arg)
	* Bug: Altered the dhandler to explicitly inherit from the input autohandler
	  because the autohandler doesn't get executed without it (appears to be
	  another HTML::Mason resolver bug)
	* Bug: Fixed a typo in the 90-html-links filter. It appears to have been
	  accidentally overwritten with the 90-css-links filter.
	* Change: Pulled session startup/shutdown out of the input autohandler.
	* Change: Contentment::Session does it's own session startup/shutdown.
	* Change: The session and session_id variables of Contentment::Context are
	  no longer read-only.

Contentment Version 0.9b4

	* Fix: The repository contains 0.10b1 as a version number. This was an
	  accident.
	* Fix: Fixed the title of the documentation for Contentment.pm
	* Fix: Fixed a bug causing problems with the way Contentment->configuration
	  was being called from Contentment::VFS.
	* Fix: Fixed the way the VFS is configured in the configuration defaults.
	* Fix: Fixed the way that $ENV{PATH_INFO} is used so that Contentment is
	  able to actually return pages.
	* Feature: Top level errors dump a simple stack trace to the contentment
	  logs.
	* Feature: Added Contentment->call_hooks(), but haven't started using it.
	* Change: Top level errors are now "error" rather than "fatal".
	* Change: VFS properties now prefer the file-based properties over the
	  filetype properties.
